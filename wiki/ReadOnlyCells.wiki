== Mark cells as read-only ==
To mark cell as read-only class "read_only" should be added to the <td> tag that contains read-only text. Example is shown in the following listing:

{{{
 <table id="myDataTable">
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Company name</th>
                <th>Address</th>
                <th>Town</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
                <tr id="17">
                    <td class="read_only">Emkay Entertainments</td>
                    <td>Nobel House, Regent Centre</td>
                    <td class="read_only">Lothian</td>
                </tr>
                <tr id="18">
                    <td>The Empire</td>
                    <td class="read_only">Milton Keynes Leisure Plaza</td>
                    <td>Buckinghamshire</td>
                </tr>
        </tbody>
</table>

}}}
In this example 1^st^, 3^rd^, and 5^th^ cells in the table are marked as read-only. Therefore, clicking on these cellseditor will not be shown.
You can use these classes to make entire rows or columns read-only - just generate "read_only" class to the cells you want to make non-editable. You can see how read-only cells are cofigured on the [http://jquery-datatables-editable.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/index.html live demo] page
